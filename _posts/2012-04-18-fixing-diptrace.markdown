title: Fixing DipTrace for OS X
---

There is a [freeware version][download] of DipTrace for OS X available (altough
actually it's only a Wine wrapper around the Windows version). When you attempt
to launch the schematic or PCB layout apps for the first time, they may just
hang at the splash screen. If so, install the latest version of [XQuartz][],
then log out and back in again.

[XQuartz]: http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/
