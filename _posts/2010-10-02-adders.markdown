title: Half and Full Adders
---

The following is a classic [half adder] [half adder] circuit, built with XOR
and NAND gates:

The XOR gate decides the parity of the output bit S, and the two NAND gates act
as an AND gate for the inputs, deciding whether the carry bit Cout should be
set.

Here's a [full adder] [full adder], which also deals with an incoming carry
bit:
