title: DBNZ CPU
---

I've decided to build a CPU that supports only one instruction: `DBNZ`. That
is, Decrement and Branch if Not Zero. Each instruction consists of two bytes.
The first gives a memory location whose value should be decremented, and the
second consists of the memory location from which to fetch the next instruction
if the result is non-zero.

Following the examples I saw in [Computer Organization and Design] [coad], I've
sketched out a data path for the CPU:
