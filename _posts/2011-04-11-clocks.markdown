title: Clocks

After some time off for the wedding, I've started back on the track to build
the `DBNZ` CPU. It's going to involve a level of complexity I'm not ready for
yet, so I'm building the components piece by piece to get familiar with them.

First up is clocks. Here's a really simple one based on an inverter with a
Schmitt trigger, such as the [74HCT14][74HCT14].

If the input to the inverter starts low, then the output is high and slowly
charges the capacitor through the [RC network][rc]. The output stays stable
during the charging due to the Schmitt trigger, but once the upper threshold
voltage is reached it flips, and the capacitor begins discharging. Eventually
it hits the lower threshold, and starts over again.

The frequency depends on the lower and upper thresholds, which according to the
datasheet are about 1.8 V and 2.8 V when VCC is 5 V.

Here's a clock that uses a [555 timer][555] and has a reset input.

Bring the reset# input low to immediately bring the clock output low and keep
it there.
