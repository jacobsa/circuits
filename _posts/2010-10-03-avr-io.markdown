title: Notes on AVR I/O

How to hook up the cheap [AVR-ISP500 programmer] [isp500] I bought on Sparkfun
(programmer/header pin to AVR pin):

 *  `V_TAR` to `Vcc`
 *  `MOSI` to `MOSI`
 *  `GND` to `GND`
 *  `MISO` to `MISO`
 *  `SCK` to `SCK`
 *  `TRST` to `RESET`

 And the [FT232RL] [ft232rl] USB to serial breakout board (breakout to AVR):

 *  `TXD` to `RXD`
 *  `RXD` to `TXD`
 *  `GND` to `GND`

Note that `RXD` is connected to `TXD` and vice versa, and that the `3.3V` pin
is left unconnected.
